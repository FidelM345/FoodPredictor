# FoodPredictor
A Convolution Neural Network Model for predicting various types of food.
Use this Repo to improve your understandig of deep learinig using CNN. In the project I use dataset from the foodvision 101 research paper.
The original authors of the paper used Random Forest Machine learnig to generate their model prediction. However, in this repo I have constructed a simple CNN deep
learning model using only 10% of training data from the foodvision 101 dataset and achieved a higher prediction accuracy of around 58% in comparision to the paper's 53%. The magic of my model is found in its ability to generate a higher accuracy results using only a small dataset
